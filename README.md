The repository includes structs and corresponding functions for:
  sllnode : single linked list node
  sll : single linked list
  
  sllp : single linked list plus
  sllqu : single linked list plus based queue
  sllst : single linked list based stack
  
  qu : array based queue
  st : array based stack

  bubble sort
  quick sort
  linear search
  binary search

The tests are simple procedures that I run to see if any segmentation fault is happening.
Idk if there will ever be any proper testing to the project...
